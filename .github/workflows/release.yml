name: Conventional Release

# Runs a conventional-commits-based version bump using `standard-version`.
# - Triggered manually or on pushes to `main` (skips runs triggered by GitHub Actions bot to avoid loops).
# - Bumps package.json version, creates a changelog, tags the release, and pushes the commit+tag.
